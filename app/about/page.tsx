          <p>
            The Fennec OSS Fund was established in 2023 with a simple mission: to support and nurture the open-source
            software ecosystem in Algeria. We believe that by providing small but meaningful financial support to
            developers and projects, we can help foster innovation, build technical skills, and create a vibrant
            community of open-source contributors.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is to identify promising open-source projects created by Algerian developers and provide them
            with the financial support they need to grow. We focus on projects that demonstrate technical excellence,
            solve real problems, and have the potential for broader impact.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Microgrants?</h2>
          <p>
            We believe that even small amounts of funding (â‚¬100-500) can make a significant difference for developers
            who are passionate about their projects but may lack resources. These microgrants can help cover costs such
            as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Server and infrastructure expenses</li>
            <li>Development tools and software</li>
            <li>Learning resources</li>
            <li>Time to focus on development</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p>The Fennec OSS Fund operates according to these core values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> We are open about our selection process and funding decisions.
